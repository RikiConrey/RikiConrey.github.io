## Welcome to Riki Conrey's sandbox

I am a psychologist and data scientist interested in how people change their minds. This little sandbox holds some toys that I've made--analyses using small amounts of data from a wide variety of sources to address very small parts of the big question of how persuasion happens.

I gave a little lightning talk about some of what I've been working on at 2018 Crack the Code: [Perfecting Persuasion](http://rikiconrey.github.io/clustering_presentation.html) 

I think we can learn a lot about how persuasion happens by studying authentic conversations that people have about divisive issues. As an example, analyzed a very small sample of exchanges about abortion to find out [how emotional tone affects responses](http://rikiconrey.github.io/emotion_stories.html)
